### Convert GCM output from standard/Earth-like coordinates into a tidally locked coordinate system.
These transformations are useful for GCM simulations of slowly rotating tidally locked planets, i.e., Earth-like planets inside the habitable zone of small stars.
For derivations and definitions, see Koll & Abbot (2015), Appendix B.
